## Abstract

Efficient resource management in Kubernetes clusters is crucial for modern 
cloud-native applications, where dynamic scaling must adapt to fluctuating demands 
while minimizing latency and cost. Traditional autoscaling methods, like Horizontal 
Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA), rely on basic resource 
metrics such as CPU and memory usage. While these methods are effective in many 
cases, they often struggle to handle complex, real-time applications with 
unpredictable traffic patterns and latency-sensitive workloads. 
Recent developments in machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) 
offer adaptive, data-driven solutions to improve autoscaling in Kubernetes 
environments. ML models can predict future resource needs, allowing for proactive 
resource allocation before performance issues arise. RL-based approaches enable 
dynamic optimization, adjusting resource allocations based on continuous feedback 
from system performance. 
However, challenges persist, especially regarding latency-aware scaling and workload 
prediction. Existing solutions often fail to integrate latency constraints or struggle to 
predict traffic patterns accurately. This literature review explores recent advancements 
in Kubernetes autoscaling, examining ML and RL techniques, hybrid approaches, and 
their limitations. This aims to highlight the progress made and the gaps that remain in 
developing efficient and adaptive autoscaling strategies for Kubernetes clusters.
